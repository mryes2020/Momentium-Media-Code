# Description 
This project is all about a social media website I made in around 1 week. 
The code itself is not beautiful, and it does not have all the mechanics a normal social media has like likes, comments and so on 
But yeah.. its okay for me

# Installation 
To install it just do `git clone https://github.com/mryes2020/Momentium-Media-Code`
And then: `cd Momentium-Media-Code; npm install`
you must have a firebase.google.com account<br>
after setting an account up, make a cloud firestore database and copy paste its api config into the /src/components/firebase/database-connection.js and you are ready to roll<br>
If you get stuck, contact me in anyway or just find a good tutorial online<br>
for example.. this is what i found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UOkri_WNWQ&ab_channel=AlrightDevelopment<br><br>
# Start the website on local server
To start it use `npm start` command inside the installation folder
