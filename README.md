# Description 
This project is all about a social media website I made in around 1 week. <br>
The code itself is not beautiful, and it does not have all the mechanics a normal social media has like likes, comments and so on <br>
But yeah.. its okay for me<br>

# Installation 
To install it just do `git clone https://github.com/mryes2020/Momentium-Media-Code` <br>
And then: `cd Momentium-Media-Code; npm install` <br>
you must have a firebase.google.com account<br>
after setting an account up, make a cloud firestore database and copy paste its api config into the /src/components/firebase/database-connection.js and you are ready to roll<br>
If you get stuck, contact me in anyway or just find a good tutorial online<br>
for example.. this is what i found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UOkri_WNWQ&ab_channel=AlrightDevelopment<br><br>
# Start the website on local server<br>
To start it use `npm start` command inside the installation folder<br>

### Warning 
If you have any questions or trouble in understanding the code you can shoot me a message on my instagram page or on my email, I should reply in 1-3 days.<br>
